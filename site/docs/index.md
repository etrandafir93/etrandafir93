_Hey there, I'm Emanuel - a Software Craftsman from Romania._

I value **simplicity and intentionality** over blindly applying patterns and abstractions. 

I care deeply about the **design and testability** of the software I create. 

I also value **communication and collaboration** and enjoy sharing my knowledge through open-source contributions and technical articles.
