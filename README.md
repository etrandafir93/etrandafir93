I value **simplicity and intentionality** over blindly applying patterns and abstractions. I care deeply about the **design and testability** of the software I create. I also value **communication and collaboration** and enjoy sharing my knowledge through open-source contributions and technical articles.

## üöÄ Design
- [Vertical Slice Architecture](https://www.baeldung.com/java-vertical-slice-architecture) - Let's organize the codebase by business capabilities rather than technical concerns. This approach slices the application vertically and challenges the traditional, layered, approach.
- [Monads In Java](https://www.baeldung.com/java-monads) - Functional programming paradigms and their abstract algebra terms can be overwhelming... But, getting a handle on "monads" will help us better grasp modern Java APIs.
In this article, I've tried to find the right balance between theory and practical Java examples.
- [Less Mocks, More Functions](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/less-mocks-more-functions-860aac67d4a7?source=friends_link&sk=b5ab72d0610c23514f0ee235e612a400) - Using the Functional Programming paradigm to push the impurities outside of our domain, and increase its testability.
- ["Tidy First?" - Book Review](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/tidy-first-and-my-post-reading-commitments-ecbde5fc39e7?source=friends_link&sk=4510b84b876fd117a78ef3ba5f486761) - My thoughts on Kent Beck's "Tidy First?" and my post-reading commitments.
- [Anemic vs Rich Domain Objects](https://www.baeldung.com/java-anemic-vs-rich-domain-objects) - Not everything is about FP! In this article, we'll question "getters" and "setters", we'll empower our objects by encapsulating business logic and enriching our domain.

## üîç Testing
- [Model Based Testing with Testcontainers and Jqwik](https://www.docker.com/blog/model-based-testing-testcontainers-jqwik/) - Running our apps through a marathon of random scenarios to see which version collapses first.
- [The Anatomy Of Mocks In Unit Testing](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-anatomy-of-mocks-in-unit-testing-3e6a78b2b5d3?source=friends_link&sk=702d3eb26b853a0fad7b54d0f78c2894) - In the article, we'll learn about "Fakes", "Stubs", "Mocks", and "Spies"... without using a mocking library.
- [Spring Boot Support for Testcontainers](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-built-in-testcontainers) - A leap towards reliable testing.  
- [Testcontainers Desktop](https://www.baeldung.com/testcontainers-desktop) - Probably the best way of debugging your Testcontainers.


## üòÜ Day to Day life
- [Three Nerdy Developer Jokes I Told My Fiancee](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/three-nerdy-developer-jokes-i-told-my-fiancee-she-was-not-impressed-f719ae8bb94d?source=friends_link&sk=039e555b2f8b13d68fe4444c92db1aec) - A glimpse into the nerdy jokes my wife endures daily.
