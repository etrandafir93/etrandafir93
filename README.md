I value **simplicity and intentionality** over blindly applying patterns and abstractions. I care deeply about the **design and testability** of the software I create. I also value **communication and collaboration** and enjoy sharing my knowledge through open-source contributions and technical articles.

## 🚀 Design
- [Vertical Slice Architecture](https://www.baeldung.com/java-vertical-slice-architecture) - Let's organize the codebase by business capabilities rather than technical concerns. This approach slices the application vertically and challenges the traditional, layered, approach.
- [Monads In Java](https://www.baeldung.com/java-monads) - Functional programming paradigms and their abstract algebra terms can be overwhelming... But, getting a handle on "monads" will help us better grasp modern Java APIs.
In this article, I've tried to find the right balance between theory and practical Java examples.
- ["Tidy First?" - Book Review](https://blog.etrandafir.com/blog/tidy-first-commitments/) - My thoughts on Kent Beck's "Tidy First?" and my post-reading commitments.
- [Anemic vs Rich Domain Objects](https://www.baeldung.com/java-anemic-vs-rich-domain-objects) - Not everything is about FP! In this article, we'll question "getters" and "setters", we'll empower our objects by encapsulating business logic and enriching our domain.
- [Poison Pills and Magic Bytes](https://www.baeldung.com/kafka-fix-unknown-magic-byte-errors) - Error handling in event-driven architectures with, Spring Boot and Kafka.

## 🔍 Testing
- [Model Based Testing with Testcontainers and Jqwik](https://www.docker.com/blog/model-based-testing-testcontainers-jqwik/) - Running our apps through a marathon of random scenarios to see which version collapses first.
- [Less Mocks, More Functions](https://blog.etrandafir.com/blog/less-mocks-more-functions/) - Using the Functional Programming paradigm to push the impurities outside of our domain, and increase its testability.
- [Spring Boot Support for Testcontainers](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-built-in-testcontainers) - A leap towards reliable testing.  


And this is just a brief selection, [(see all articles here)](https://www.baeldung.com/author/emanueltrandafir).
